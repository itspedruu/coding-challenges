## Number of Boomerangs - Difficulty: Easy

This challenge consisted on given n points that are all pairwise, get the maximum number of boomerangs possible. A boomerang is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k`. I began to create a loop for the points given, let's call the variable from this loop `i` and created a loop again, let's call the variable from this one `j`, inside the loop. I calculated the distance from `i` to `j` and added to a dictionary with all the diferent distances and then calculated the maximum possibilites of boomerangs possible for each distance using math.
